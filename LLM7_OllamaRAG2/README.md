# LLM7 Ollama RAG chatbot 2

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LlamaIndex to assist employees in accessing accurate and timely information about Capital Oneâ€™s 2025 benefits offerings. The chatbot will leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced by an external knowledge base, the 2025 Capital One Benefits PDF document, to retrieve and generate relevant answers to employee inquiries.  This version of the chatbot will have a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit.
